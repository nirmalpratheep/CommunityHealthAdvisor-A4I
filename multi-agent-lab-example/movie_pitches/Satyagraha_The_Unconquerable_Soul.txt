Logline: A timid lawyer transforms into a global icon, leading a nation to freedom through the revolutionary power of nonviolent resistance, only to face the ultimate sacrifice in his quest for peace amidst a divided land.

Three-Act Plot Outline:

Act 1: The Awakening of a Soul
*   **Introduction:** Young Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a shy Indian lawyer, struggles to find his footing after studying in London, feeling a sense of displacement and uncertainty.
*   **Inciting Incident (South Africa):** While working in South Africa, Gandhi experiences blatant racial discrimination firsthand, including being thrown off a train. This pivotal moment sparks his moral outrage and leads him to develop and first employ Satyagraha (nonviolent resistance) in a campaign for civil rights for Indians. He finds his purpose and voice, transforming from a hesitant lawyer into a determined activist.
*   **Return to India:** After two decades of honing his methods in South Africa, he returns to an India under oppressive British rule, witnessing the widespread poverty, injustice, and lack of self-determination, feeling a renewed call to action to apply his philosophy on a larger scale. He begins to organize local protests and connect with the common people.

Act 2: The March Towards Freedom
*   **Rise to Leadership:** Gandhi assumes leadership of the Indian National Congress, transforming it from an elite organization into a mass movement. He adopts a simple, ascetic lifestyle, including wearing a dhoti, to identify with India's rural poor, earning him the affectionate title "Bapu."
*   **Major Campaigns:** He orchestrates nationwide campaigns against British policies, including the iconic Dandi Salt March to protest the salt tax, and the "Quit India" movement, galvanizing millions through civil disobedience and non-cooperation. His methods challenge the might of the British Empire and draw international attention.
*   **Personal Sacrifices & Imprisonments:** Gandhi faces numerous arrests, long imprisonments, and undertakes fasts for introspection and political protest, enduring immense personal hardships. Despite the challenges, his unwavering resolve strengthens, inspiring his followers and solidifying his moral authority.
*   **Internal Conflicts:** He grapples with the growing complexities of religious divisions within India, particularly the rise of Muslim nationalism, and the immense pressure of leading a diverse nation towards independence while trying to maintain unity.

Act 3: A Divided Victory and Lasting Legacy
*   **Independence and Partition:** India finally achieves independence from British rule, a monumental triumph. However, the victory is tragically marred by the partition of British India into India and Pakistan, leading to widespread communal violence and mass displacement. Gandhi is heartbroken by the bloodshed.
*   **Quest for Peace:** A devastated Gandhi dedicates himself to quelling the religious strife, undertaking hunger strikes and visiting affected areas to promote harmony and peace, even as his vision of a united, pluralistic India crumbles around him. He works tirelessly to alleviate suffering and bridge divides.
*   **Climax (Assassination):** His unwavering commitment to peace and reconciliation, particularly his efforts to protect Muslims in India, ultimately leads to his assassination by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist. This final, tragic sacrifice underscores the profound cost of his ideals.
*   **Resolution/Legacy:** The film concludes with the immediate aftermath of his death, the profound grief of a nation and the world, and a reflection on his enduring legacy as the "Father of the Nation" and a global symbol of nonviolent resistance, whose birthday is celebrated worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence.
