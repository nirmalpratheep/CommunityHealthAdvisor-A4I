    *   Inciting Incident: His breakthrough role as Dr. Doug Ross on "ER" catapults him to superstardom, opening doors to major film roles and a life of glamour. He experiences the intoxicating highs of celebrity but also the superficiality.
    *   Rising Action: George establishes himself as a bankable leading man with films like *Out of Sight* and *Ocean's Eleven*.

*   Act 2: The Conscience Awakens
    *   Confrontation: George faces a personal or professional crossroads. He realizes the immense power of his voice and decides to actively engage with global issues, particularly the Darfur crisis. This shift is met with skepticism from some, who see it as a celebrity fad.
    *   Rising Action: He dives into filmmaking with a social conscience, directing and starring in projects like *Good Night, and Good Luck* and winning an Oscar for *Syriana*, demonstrating his commitment to impactful storytelling. His activism intensifies, leading to dangerous trips and direct engagement with political leaders.

He must leverage all his skills – his charm, his filmmaking prowess, and his unwavering moral compass – to achieve a breakthrough. This could involve a tense negotiation, a powerful public address, or the successful release of a groundbreaking film like *Argo* (which he produced).
